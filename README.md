# Data Integration and Knowledge Representation for AI Systems 

This repository contains a stand-alone jupyter notebook demonstrating how the CHAKRA knowledge representation framework can be used to build knowledge bases for AI systems from distributed, heterogenous data sources. 

Click [here](https://nick-harley.github.io/data-integration/demo.html) to view the notebook page.

- ``demo.ipynb`` is the Jupyter notebook.
- ``demo.jl`` is a Julia source file containing all the code from the notebook.
- ``demo.html`` is an HTML version of the Jupyter notebook.
- ``dwi.xml`` and ``STEPS.csv`` are two data sources used for the construction of the knowledge base.
- ``kb.png`` is a diagram illustrating the structure of the knowledge base.
- ``query.json`` is a JSON serialisation of a query that applies to the knowledge base.
